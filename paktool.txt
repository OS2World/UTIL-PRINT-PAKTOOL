Printer PAK Tool (PAKTOOL)
Version 30.904


EXPLANATION

PAKTOOL is a PostScript driver PAK file analysis/disassembly tool.

The OS/2 PostScript printer drivers (whether the original PSCRIPT.DRV, or 
ECUPS/ECUPS-HP or PSPRINT) store all information about supported printer
devices (models) in a pair of data files that reside in the same directory as
the driver itself:
 - PRINTER1.PAK contains all devices that were originally built into the driver
   at compile time.
 - AUXPRINT.PAK contains all devices that have been imported by the user from
   PPD files, using the PIN utility.

PAKTOOL, simply put, is a command-line utility for analyzing and selectively
decompiling these PAK files.

When run on the specified PAK file, PAKTOOL can do any of the following:
 - List all printer devices defined in the PAK file
 - Dump the binary PAKfile data for the specified printer in raw and/or
   hexadecimal format.
 - Display the PAKfile data for the specified printer in human-readable format. 
 - "Decompile" the specified printer's data into a PPD file.

Unfortunately, the PAK file format is dependent on the PostScript driver, and
is slightly different depending on which specific driver is being examined.
Therefore, three different executables are provided, each one built for use
with a particular PostScript driver:

 epaktool.exe    For ECUPS/ECUPS-HP.DRV, or IBM's PSCRIPT.DRV version 30.800
 ipaktool.exe    For IBM's PSCRIPT.DRV, version 30.822 and later
 ppaktool.exe    For PSPRINT.DRV

Basically, the ECUPS* drivers are built from the IBM DDK sources, which are
based on PSCRIPT.DRV version 30.800.  Later versions of PSCRIPT.DRV (for which
no source code is available) changed the internal structures slightly.  (I had
to use a lot of trial-and-error analysis to work out where the changes were.)
PSPRINT.DRV is also based on the 30.800 sources, but makes its own particular
changes to the internal structures.



USAGE:

  epaktool <pakfile> [<action> ["<printer name>"] ]
  ipaktool <pakfile> [<action> ["<printer name>"] ]
  ppaktool <pakfile> [<action> ["<printer name>"] ]

where
 <pakfile> is either PRINTER1.PAK or AUXPRINT.PAK;
 <action> is one of the following:
   L - List all defined printers (this is the default if nothing is specified).

   P - Generate PPD file for <printer name>
   V - Display data about <printer name>, shown according to the internal data.
       structures used.
   R - Display data about <printer name> in a format optimized for readability.

   D - Dump all <printer name>'s data as raw bytes.
   X - Dump all <printer name>'s data as hexadecimal byte values.
   B - Dump all <printer name>'s data in a combined table format.

If <printer name> is not specified (all actions except L), then the first 
printer found in <pakfile> will be assumed.

All output goes to STDOUT; generally, you will want to redirect this to a file.

Running the program with no arguments will display brief help.



Source code is included.  PAKTOOL is released to the public domain.
